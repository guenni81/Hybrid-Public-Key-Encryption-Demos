## Important Disclaimer
This project is for learning purposes. It intentionally exposes private keys and secret values in console output to explain HPKE internals. This behavior is insecure by design and must not be used in production systems.

## Cryptographic Warning
Cryptographic software is error-prone and sensitive to subtle mistakes. This demo has not been presented as side-channel hardened and should not be considered production-grade cryptographic engineering.

## AI Disclosure
AI-assisted output may contain mistakes. Any cryptographic code derived from this demo requires independent review, testing, and professional security audit before real-world deployment.
