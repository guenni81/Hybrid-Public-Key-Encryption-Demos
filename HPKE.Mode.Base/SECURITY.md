If you believe you have found a security issue, please open an issue in this repository or contact the repository owner. Use responsible disclosure and include a proof-of-concept and clear reproduction steps.

## Important Disclaimer
This repository is for educational purposes only. It demonstrates cryptographic primitives and intentionally exposes private keys and secrets for learning. It must NOT be used in production systems.

## Cryptographic Warning
Cryptography is sensitive to subtle implementation errors. This project does not guarantee side-channel resistance, and no formal security audit has been performed unless explicitly stated otherwise.

## AI Disclosure
